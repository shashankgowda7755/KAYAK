3. Name it: `munroe-island-website` (or any name you prefer)
4. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Upload your files:
1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Clone your new repository to your computer
3. Copy ALL files from this folder to the GitHub repository folder

   **Variable Name**: `NODE_ENV`

3. Click "Deploy"

## Step 4: Wait and Test

1. Vercel will build and deploy your site (takes 2-3 minutes)
2. You'll get a URL like: `https://your-site-name.vercel.app`

4. Check if all features work:

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the "Functions" tab in Vercel for error logs
2. Make sure your DATABASE_URL is correctly added
3. Verify your Neon database is active (not paused)

### If website doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test database connection
