# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution

Your website is failing on Vercel because the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not configured in your Vercel deployment settings. The application has a fallback mechanism that uses in-memory storage when the database is not available, but you need to properly configure the environment variables for full functionality.

## Steps to Fix the Deployment

### 1. Add Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `munroe-island-kayaking`
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following environment variable:

   **Variable Name:** `DATABASE_URL`
   **Value:** `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_GzwY50vlFXSg@ep-round-credit-a1nshwa8-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`
   **Environment:** Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 2. Redeploy Your Application

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to the **Deployments** tab in your Vercel dashboard
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to your GitHub repository to trigger automatic deployment

### 3. Verify the Deployment

Once redeployed:
1. Check the deployment logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Look for the message: "Using Database storage" (instead of "Using In-memory storage fallback")
3. Test your website functionality

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated `vercel.json`**: Improved the configuration for better serverless function handling
2. **Environment Variable Setup**: The main issue was missing `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Your app already has a fallback to in-memory storage when database is unavailable

## Alternative: Using Vercel CLI

If you prefer using the command line:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Set environment variable
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
# When prompted, paste your database URL and select all environments

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## Important Notes

- Your Neon database URL is already configured in your local `.env` file
- The application will work with in-memory storage but data won't persist between deployments
- With the database properly connected, all booking inquiries and content will be stored permanently
- Make sure your Neon database is active and accessible from Vercel's servers

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel function logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your Neon database is not paused (free tier databases auto-pause after inactivity)
3. Test the database connection from your local environment
4. Ensure the database URL doesn't contain any special characters that need encoding

After following these steps, your website should work correctly on Vercel with full database functionality!
