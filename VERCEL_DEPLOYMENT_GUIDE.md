# Vercel Deployment Guide - FIXED

## ✅ Issues Resolved

The following critical deployment issues have been identified and fixed:

1. **vercel.json Configuration**: Updated to use modern Vercel configuration format
2. **Build Compatibility**: Fixed import.meta.dirname compatibility for Node.js environments
3. **Database Migrations**: Generated proper migration files for deployment
4. **Build Scripts**: Updated package.json with proper Vercel build commands

## Steps to Deploy Successfully

### 1. Add Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following environment variable:

   **Variable Name:** `DATABASE_URL`
   **Value:** `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_GzwY50vlFXSg@ep-round-credit-a1nshwa8-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`
   **Environment:** Select all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 2. Deploy with Fixed Configuration

After adding the environment variable:
1. Push the latest changes to your GitHub repository (all fixes are now applied)
2. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment
3. Or manually redeploy from the **Deployments** tab in your Vercel dashboard

### 3. Verify the Deployment

Once redeployed:
1. Check the deployment logs in Vercel dashboard for any errors
2. Look for successful database connection messages
3. Test your website functionality including contact forms and booking inquiries
4. Verify that the site loads without authentication prompts

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **vercel.json Configuration**: 
   - Removed deprecated "builds" configuration
   - Updated to modern Vercel format with proper function settings
   - Increased function timeout to 30 seconds

2. **Build Compatibility Issues**:
   - Fixed import.meta.dirname compatibility for Node.js deployment
   - Added proper URL path resolution for serverless environments

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Generated proper migration files in /migrations folder
   - Added database generation to build process
   - Updated build scripts for proper deployment sequence

4. **Package.json Scripts**:
   - Added proper vercel-build command with database generation
   - Added postinstall script for migration generation

## Alternative: Using Vercel CLI

If you prefer using the command line:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Set environment variable
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
# When prompted, paste your database URL and select all environments

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## Important Notes

- Your Neon database URL is already configured in your local `.env` file
- The application will work with in-memory storage but data won't persist between deployments
- With the database properly connected, all booking inquiries and content will be stored permanently
- Make sure your Neon database is active and accessible from Vercel's servers

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel function logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your Neon database is not paused (free tier databases auto-pause after inactivity)
3. Test the database connection from your local environment
4. Ensure the database URL doesn't contain any special characters that need encoding

After following these steps, your website should work correctly on Vercel with full database functionality!
